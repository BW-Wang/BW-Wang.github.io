title: "Photovoltaic Intelligent Roof"
excerpt: "We propose the inverse semantic communications as a new paradigm. Instead of extracting semantic information from messages, we aim to encode the taskrelated source messages into a hyper-source message for data transmission or storage. Following this paradigm, we design an inverse semantic-aware wireless sensing framework with three algorithms for data sampling, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided encoding, and self-supervised decoding, respectively. Using the sensing data collected from real-world, we show that our framework can reduce the data volume by 95% compared to that before encoding, without affecting the accomplishment of sensing tasks."

**Abstract**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted a lot of research attention in serving as aerial base stations (BSs). To protect the data privacy without being detected by a warden, we investigate a jammer-aided UAV covert communication system, aiming to maximize the userâ€™s covert rate with optimized transmit and jamming power. By considering the general composite fading and shadowing channel models, we derive the closedform expressions for detection error probability and covert rate. The covert rate maximization problem is formulated as a Nash bargaining game, and the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) is introduced. To solve the NBS, we propose a particle swarm optimization-based power allocation algorithm. The numerical results are presented to verify the theoretical analysis.
