**Abstract**: This paper proposes a cooperative cell-free dual-function radar-communication (CoCF-DFRC) network adopting hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture, which improves both radar sensing and communication performance. In the proposed CoCF-DFRC network, a central processor unit coordinates multiple access points (APs) to cooperatively provide communication services to users and detect multiple targets of interest. To show the benefits of the CoCF-DFRC network, we propose to jointly design the HBF to maximize the network communication capacity while satisfying the constraint of beampattern similarity for radar sensing, which results in a highly dimensional and non-convex problem. To facilitate the joint design, we propose a novel distributed optimization framework based on proximal gradient and alternating direction method of multipliers, namely PANDA, which is further adopted to solve the joint HBF design problem for the CoCF-DFRC network. By adopting the proposed PANDA framework, all APs optimize the HBF in parallel, where each AP only requires local channel state information and limited message exchange among the APs. Such framework reduces significantly the computational complexity and thus has pronounced benefits in practical scenarios. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with the conventional centralized algorithm and show the remarkable performance improvement of radar sensing and communication by deploying CoCF-DFRC networks.
