<b>Abstracct: </b> In this letter, we study the Hybrid Beamforming (HBF) design for a Dual-Function Radar-Communication (DFRC) system, which serves Multiple Users (MUs) and detects a target in the presence of signal-dependent clutters, simultaneously. Unlike conventional beamforming strategies, we propose a novel one on the symbol level, which exploits Constructive Interference (CI) to achieve a trade-off between radar and communication using one platform. To implement this novel strategy, we jointly design the DFRC transmit HBF and radar receive beamforming by maximizing the radar Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) while ensuring the Quality of Service (QoS) of downlink communication. To tackle the formulated non-convex problem, we propose an iterative algorithm, which combines the Majorization-Minimization (MM) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) judiciously. The numerical experiments indicate that our algorithm yields the CI properly for robust communications and achieves better performance than the conventional HBF benchmarks in both communication bit error rate and radar SINR.
