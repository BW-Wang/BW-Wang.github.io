In order to solve the problems of insufficient solar radiation reception and low efficiency of photovoltaic power generation in the existing photovoltaic energy-saving roof buildings in China, the project team proposed a high-efficiency energy-saving and refined design method based on the idea of refined design and combined with intelligent control technology, considering the regional and climatic characteristics, roof inclination, house specifications and skylight size and location Know about energy saving roof system. The project team optimizes the HT model, proposes the optimal PV inclination algorithm based on the factors of clear sky index, sunshine events and roof area, calculates the roof inclination which makes the roof inclination receive the maximum annual radiation, studies the optimal skylight layout model, and determines the skylight distribution location which makes the indoor lighting optimal and the back heat dissipation of PV array optimal, and establishes the intelligent design platform, which can be used according to the transmission and distribution According to the architectural requirements, the refined design scheme is generated. After the installation of the intelligent skylight, the control platform will fuse the sensing information of each sensor with the meteorological data transferred from the weather station to realize the accurate control of the skylight baffle. The system maximizes the solar radiation reception of photovoltaic array on inclined roof, and cooperatively optimizes indoor lighting and photovoltaic array heat dissipation. It can not only prevent the skylight glass from being exposed to dust in haze and windy weather, save the maintenance cost of the skylight glass, but also enhance the heat dissipation of the photovoltaic back and improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic array. The project improves the annual power generation of roof photovoltaic array, reduces the lighting power consumption and maintenance cost of skylight, and has good energy saving and emission reduction benefits.
