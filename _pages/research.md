## Dual-Function Radar-Communication (DFRC)

***Time:*** From 10/2020 to Present

***Content:***  THE increasing number of wireless devices leads to more and more serious spectrum congestion. As a consequence,
there is a serious spectrum overlap between different devices, such as airbone radars and navigation systems are close to the 3.4GHz band, which partially overlap with the Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems. Another instance is that the communication satellite (CS) systems and Wi-Fi systems operate in the C-band (4-8 GHz), which is also utilized by the military radars. To address the spectrum congestion between radar and communication, the communication radar spectrum sharing (CRSS) technology is a promising way.

  To handle the limitations of the co-existence with two platforms, the dual-function radar communication (DFRC) system, where radar and communication share in a common platform, has been regarded as a more favorable approach to realize the CRSS.

## Photovoltaic Intelligent Roof

***Time:*** From 11/2019 to 07/2020

***Content:*** In order to solve the problems of insufficient solar radiation reception and low efficiency of photovoltaic power generation in the existing photovoltaic energy-saving roof buildings in China, the project team proposed a high-efficiency energy-saving and refined design method based on the idea of refined design and combined with intelligent control technology, considering the regional and climatic characteristics, roof inclination, house specifications and skylight size and location Know about energy saving roof system.

According to the architectural requirements, the refined design scheme is generated. After the installation of the intelligent skylight, the control platform will fuse the sensing information of each sensor with the meteorological data transferred from the weather station to realize the accurate control of the skylight baffle. The system maximizes the solar radiation reception of photovoltaic array on inclined roof, and cooperatively optimizes indoor lighting and photovoltaic array heat dissipation. It can not only prevent the skylight glass from being exposed to dust in haze and windy weather, save the maintenance cost of the skylight glass, but also enhance the heat dissipation of the photovoltaic back and improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic array. The project improves the annual power generation of roof photovoltaic array, reduces the lighting power consumption and maintenance cost of skylight, and has good energy saving and emission reduction benefits.
